# Radikari Data Processing Automation

## Introduction

Welcome to my First Project in Radikari!

This project is created to assist Radikari in streamlining their data processes. With over 2 million rows of data generated monthly, the data analysis tasks can become daunting, especially towards the end of each month. Currently, Radikari relies on Excel and Google Spreadsheets for data processing, resulting in a highly manual and time-consuming process. To address these challenges, this project leverages Python in Google Colab to automate and enhance the data processing workflow.

### Motivation

The exponential growth of data at Radikari necessitates efficient and scalable data processing solutions. Manual data manipulation in Excel and Google Spreadsheets becomes increasingly laborious and error-prone, particularly with the large volume of data generated monthly. This project aims to streamline the data processing pipeline, improve efficiency, and reduce errors by automating repetitive tasks and implementing data manipulation algorithms in Python.

### Key Objectives

- **Automated Data Processing**: Develop Python scripts to automate data processing tasks, reducing manual effort and enhancing productivity. Automation includes checking order IDs, phone numbers, changing data formats, checking statuses, checking agent IDs and names, and correcting errors.
- **Scalability**: Design scalable solutions capable of handling large volumes of data efficiently, ensuring smooth operation even during peak workload periods.
- **Data Manipulation**: Implement algorithms for data manipulation and transformation to meet Radikari's specific requirements and business needs.
- **Enhanced Data Insights**: Enable Radikari to derive actionable insights from their data more effectively, facilitating data-driven decision-making processes.

By harnessing the power of Python in Google Colab, this project aims to revolutionize Radikari's data processing workflow, empowering them to unlock the full potential of their data assets.
